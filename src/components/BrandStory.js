        <center><p>Woody Moth began in the summer of 2012. In the midst of a monumental wardrobe <br/>

crisis, I was attempting to transition from Bryan
Bethea Urban College Grad<br/>
 to Bryan

Bethea Young Professional. I dropped off hundreds in dollars worth of designer jeans<br/>


and designer T-shirts at the local Salvation Army and began the search for a more<br/>


professional, more clean cut, more cutting edge wardrobe.<br/>


The search for a new ensemble was not an easy one. Suit jackets and slacks were<br/>


plentiful, but the vast majority of professional wear available for retail lacked the sense<br/>


of flair that I value when choosing wardrobe pieces. Every piece that I would try on was<br/>


either too professional or too trendy; nothing in between.<br/>


One of the most monotone pieces of professional wear I came across was neckties.<br/>


While I loved the idea of the tie as a distinguishing accessory, I felt boxed in by the lack<br/>


of diversity as far as their design is concerned. Tired of leaving stores empty-handed, I<br/>


abandoned the search for ties and began pursuing watches instead.<br/>


I stumbled upon a very unique watch, which possessed all the fashionable flair<br/>
 I

had been searching for. The watch was made of wood. It was uniquely crafted; both<br/>


fashionable and functional. That's when the idea hit me! The wooden watch was exactly<br/>


what I had been looking for, so why not a wooden tie?<br/>


A friend of mine who does woodworking as a hobby agreed to create a wooden tie<br/>


prototype. I put the contraption on paper and eventually progressed throughout the<br/>


entire prototyping process. The end result was my first tie; the Woody Moth: Mothman<br/>


Classic model.

The creation of Woody Moth emerged from my personal quest to possess both<br/>


contemporary and unique men's accessories; with each Woody Moth creation I hope<br/>


to pass on the pride and the self-confidence I feel when wearing something both trendy<br/>


and professional in the same outfit.<br/>

For centuries the moth has symbolized transformation and has been a symbol of<br/>


evolution. Even an insect as small as a moth shows us that change must<br/>
 take place


in order for living beings to evolve and reach their true <br/>
potential. Just as
 caterpillars


transform into moths, boys<br/>
 transform
into men and girls transform into women. </p></center>
